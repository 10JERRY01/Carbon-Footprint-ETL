# Carbon-Footprint-ETL
#Project Overview
Project Title: AI-Powered Carbon Footprint Analysis

Project Description:
This project leverages the Electricity Estimates API provided by Carbon Interface to estimate the carbon footprint from electricity consumption in different countries and states. The project focuses on building a scalable ETL pipeline, performing data transformation, and using machine learning models to predict future emissions based on historical data. The end product is a Dash web application that visualizes both historical and forecasted carbon emissions, supporting businesses and individuals in making data-driven decisions toward sustainability.

#Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python
Libraries:
Pandas: Data manipulation
NumPy: Numerical operations
scikit-learn: For machine learning models
Prophet: Time series forecasting
Dash: Web application for visualization
PostgreSQL: Database for data storage
requests: For API calls
API: Carbon Interface API for electricity estimates
Cloud Platforms: Optionally deploy the app on platforms like Heroku or AWS for scalability.

#Project Workflow
1. Data Extraction (API Call)
The first step in the project is to extract electricity consumption data and associated carbon footprint information using the Electricity Estimates API provided by Carbon Interface.

2. ETL Pipeline Design
Extract:
Extract data by calling the API for different values of electricity consumption (e.g., 42 MWh or KWh) across various countries and states.
Transform:
Transform the extracted data into a structured format, aligning it with the format required for further analysis.
Clean and handle missing or inconsistent data (e.g., null values or missing units).
Load:
Store the data into a PostgreSQL database for persistence and later use.

3. Data Analysis and Machine Learning Model
Objective: Predict future carbon emissions based on historical data using Prophet for time series forecasting.
Steps:

Use the data stored in the PostgreSQL database to train a time series forecasting model.
Preprocess data by aggregating carbon emissions values over time.
Train a Prophet model to forecast emissions.

4. Data Visualization (Dash Web Application)
Use Dash to create a web interface for visualizing the historical and forecasted carbon emissions.

5. Deployment
For deployment, use Heroku or AWS to host the Dash web application and ensure that the backend (API calls, database, and ML models) scales as needed.

#Conclusion
This project demonstrates the full implementation of an ETL pipeline, data analysis, and machine learning model to predict carbon emissions from electricity consumption. The Dash web application provides users with actionable insights into both historical and predicted data, empowering them to make more sustainable decisions.

The project aligns with current trends in data engineering, machine learning, and sustainability, and can be expanded with additional data sources, more advanced models, and broader geographic coverage for a more impactful solution.
